Overview

These are scripts to help template developers and administrators
manage various components of the Escenic Content Engine. The scripts
are experimental and not yet a part of the official distribution of
Escenic Content Engine from Vizrt Online.

Project directory layout

The file structure ressembles where you'd typically put the various
scripts and configuration files. That's all it is, only for
documentational purposes :-)
